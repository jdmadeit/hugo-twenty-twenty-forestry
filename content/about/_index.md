I was born during one of the hottest Julys ever recorded in Boston, Massachusetts.

I stayed in New England for the next 33 years where I was raised, educated and then went to work.

While finishing my MBA at northeastern, a friend had moved to SF, ca, and had an extra bedroom available to rent. I didn't have any plans for after graduation so i bought a one-way flight from Boston, ma to SF, CA.

That was six years ago and i am still here. like every transplant to the west coast, i took up hiking as a response to the culture shock of being able to go outside year round without multiple layers of clothing.

I have black cat named dracula and we live in oakland, ca where we are looking to make all your social media and marketing operation dreams come true. In my spare time I enjoy furthering my skills in Adobe and I've also take up open source website building as well.
