I was born during one of the hottest Julys ever recorded in Boston, Massachusetts in a hospital that has a photo of my mother's graduating nursing school class hanging in the lobby. 

I stayed in New England for the next 33 years where I was raised, educated and then went to work.

While finishing my MBA at northeastern, a friend had moved to SF, ca, and had an extra bedroom available to rent. I didn't have any plans for after graduation so i bought a one-way flight from Boston, MA to SF, CA.

That was six years ago and I am still here. 

I have black cat named dracula and we live in Oakland, CA where we are looking to make all your social media and marketing operation dreams come true. In my spare time I enjoy furthering my skills in Adobe and I've also take up open source website building as well.
